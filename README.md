# Google Search Results Replica

![Picture of the site](/home/renny/Pictures/google-ss.png)

- This is my **1st** project for The Odin Project. (yay!)

- The replica is only **visual**, there's no links to outside sites except the videos in the search results. 

- This is actually my **second attempt** at the project; the first time attempting this only led to piles of spaghetti code.
- The replica only uses **HTML** and **CSS**.
